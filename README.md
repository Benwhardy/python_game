# Python Shooter

This program is a scrolling 2D shooter game built with Python and Pygame. 
The objective of the game is to get across the map defeating enemies.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame

## Controls

- Move Left: `a`
- Move Right: `d`
- Jump: `w`
- Grenade: `q`
- Shoot: `space`

## Issues

There is an issue within the game where sometimes the enemies will not turn to face the player when shooting.

## Resource

The online pygame tutorial from Coding with Russ was integral to this project.

I was unable to add all of the functionality that I had originally planned. However, this project
did introduce a lot of new concepts that I had not yet seen, and presented a steep challenge at points.
I am looking forward to getting a deeper understanding of game design as a whole and hope to improve upon
this game in the future.
